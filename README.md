(1) These codes here are developed in Python. Similar (but not identical) codes are also developed in MATLAB with more features. However, MATLAB codes are not shared in my repositories

(2)The numbers, input, and dimensions provided in this code are not real purposely.

(3) 1D model developed by "Zavaliangos, Antonios, et al. Prediction of air entrapment in tableting: an approximate solution." Journal of pharmaceutical sciences 106.12 (2017): 3604-3612." has been reproduced
to predict air pressure distribution inside a cylinderical tablet under symmetrical compaction. A nonlinear transiet 1D PDE has been solved numerically.

(4) One of the main mechanisms behind lamination of the tablets is the "excessive" air entrapment. If the entrapped air pressure inside the tablet exceeds certain level, the tablet often laminates from the horizontal centerline. While tensile strength needs to be measured, max air pressure must be estimated. That is why I reprodouced the results of this paper using computer simulation

(5) The code is able to predict air pressure as a function of punch velocity, permeability, vertical displacement and punch-die gap.
