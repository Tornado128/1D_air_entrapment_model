(1) I have reproduced the 1D model developed by "Zavaliangos, Antonios, et al. Prediction of air entrapment in tableting: an approximate solution." Journal of pharmaceutical sciences 106.12 (2017): 3604-3612."
to predict air pressure distribution inside a cylinderical tablet under symmetrical compaction. A nonlinear transiet 1D PDE has been solved numerically.

(2) The motivation is that the main mechanism behind lamination of the tablets is the "excessive" air entrapment. This mechanism is the manifestation of the interplay between maximum air pressure inside the tablet and the tensile strength of the tablet. While tensile strength needs to be measured, max air pressure must be estimated. That is why we reprodouced the results of this paper using computer simulation

(3) The code is able to predict air pressure as a function of punch velocity, permeability, location of the tablet and punch-die gap
